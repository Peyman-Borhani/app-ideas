### Dashboard
> This app should resemble an HR type dashboard where a user can login and view information about the company. It can have an Employee section that shows the information of that employee like Name, Address, Phone, Email, position in company, how long they have been employed, start date, vacation time remaining etc. The app should also have some sort of project tracking. You could include in some graphs and charts that show company progress year over year. One more thing would be to add a place for the HR person to make a company wide announcement that would show up on the company intranet.

### Dedicated Compass

### Diet tracker / personalization
> Receiving list of the ingredients and meals in user's taste as well as current physical charateristics (weight, height, etc.) , this app will suggest a diet, meals to be part of the diet, nutrition facts along with their calories and shares the recipe for making the dishes in users taste and aligned with their eating habits.

This data can either be processed on cloud or be used locally to (1) calculate number of steps, (2) calculate step lengths, (3) estimate the heading direction on each step (4) recognize the activity (i.e., running, walking ...) (5) localize the user in an indoor venue (6) perform different tasks based on user's hand gesture (7) suggest shortest path to a pinned indoor destination.

### Photo booth

### Photo Cropper

### Photo sharing app

### Pizza order composer
> Stores people's preferences of toppings, and maybe crust styles too, i.e., what they like, love, dislike, hate, or are neutral to. (Alternate idea: store only the device owner's preferences, and several instances can communicate with each other to collaborate, filling in other people on an ad-hoc basis.) To put together an order, say who's there and how hungry. It should put together an order that will feed everybody, maximize happiness with the toppings, and minimize price. E.g., "1 medium half-pepperoni half-mushroom plus 2 large Hawaiians". It could get prices, and maybe locations, from assorted online sources TBD, or just make assumptions.

The manager would like to know the vineyard, location, year, style, location in cellar, how many bottles remain, selling price, buying price, as well as tasting notes. All fields need to be updatable as prices, tasting notes and years will all change frequently. It should have an image of the label/bottle as well. 

### Working parents dinner app

### YouTube API/search client
> Using the YouTube API, your app should be able to take in a string, search for the videos and return a list.
For example, if I wanted to watch Cosmos Documantries, must return most related titles, and the 1st related item with large preview ready to play on top.
If you're not specific, searching by one word, for example: "Documantry", it should return up to 10 related results in a column. 
> Extra features:  
> - 2 columns in one page
> - a button to repeat loop an item or list
> - play items by random order without repeat
> - limit number of results returned, to fit in one page and resize items thumbnail size per amount of videos.
